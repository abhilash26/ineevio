A custom made php MVC framework for small projects.

What it includes?

1. Autoloading: A namespace based autoloading system.
2. Routing: A basic GET/ POST routing.
3. MVC dispatching: A dispatch system, which generally calls controller which is registered for that path.
4. Database: A PDO wrapper class to use PDO object without any fuss.
5. Exception Handling: A custom made global exception handler.
6. Custom Exceptions: An error class "Custom Exception" to extend custom made error messages.
7. Request data handling: A Request class to handle input parameters, input headers, querystring.
8. Templating: A template class to include .art.php view files and pass controller data to the view.

The work is in progress. Suggestions are welcome.
